    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make this delicious rice recipe, you'll need just a few simple ingredients: long-grain white rice, water,
        butter or oil, and salt. Start by rinsing the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water for a minute
        or two, until the water runs clear. This step helps to remove excess starch from the rice and ensures that it
        cooks evenly. In a medium saucepan, bring the water, butter or oil, and salt to a boil over high heat. Once the
        mixture comes to a boil, add the rinsed rice and stir it once to ensure it's evenly distributed. Reduce the heat
        to low, cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer the rice for 18 minutes.</p>
    <p>After 18 minutes, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. This allows the rice
        to absorb any remaining liquid and ensures that it's fluffy and tender. Finally, fluff the rice with a fork and
        serve. You can also add other ingredients like garlic or onion to the recipe while cooking to add more flavor.
