    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is a classic and delicious pasta dish that's perfect for a weeknight dinner or a special occasion. To
        make this recipe, start by boiling a pound of spaghetti in salted water until it's al dente. While the pasta is

        translucent. Then add a can of crushed tomatoes, sugar, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes to the skillet
        and simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Finally, add chopped basil and reserved pasta
        water to the sauce and simmer for another 5 minutes before adding the cooked spaghetti to the skillet and
        tossing everything together. Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and serve hot.
